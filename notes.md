How are we displaying the item names after searching?

How do integrate another field into that process?
  -How are we handling just one field?
    we're taking the input from search field and using the indexOf function to see if it matches the itemname of the input.
    if it matches set display to "", if not set it to "none"
  -How would we change that to take two fields into account?
    we display an item if there's a match for the first search for the name and then do another search for item location so either one will match
